Butterfly Viewer is a desktop multi-image viewer with sliding overlays, synchronized pan and zoom, and other handy features to rapidly compare local image files. This can be useful for visually inspecting painting research data such as high-res and raking-light photos, X-rays, and element maps from XRF and RIS.

The Viewer runs as an [installable Windows executable](#windows-executable), a [macOS app](#macos-app), or directly on its [Python source code](#python).

Supported filetypes include PNG, JPG/JPEG, TIF/TIFF, BMP, WEBP, SVG, ICO, and CUR.

[Butterfly Registrator<sup>↗</sup>](https://olive-groves.github.io/butterfly_registrator/butterfly_registrator.html) can be used to create aligned copies of your images so you can more accurately compare them in the Viewer. The Registrator helps you align (or *register*) images to a given reference image such that their heights and widths match and the features within those images line up.

# Download and install

You can download and install Butterfly Viewer to run:
- as a [Windows executable](#windows-executable); 
- as a [macOS app](#macos-app); or 
- directly with [Python](#python). 

## Windows executable

> Download: [`butterfly_viewer_v1.y.z_win64_setup.exe.zip`<sup>↗</sup>](https://github.com/olive-groves/butterfly_viewer/releases/latest)
>
> <sup> **Restart recommended** · **110 MB installed**</sup>

For Windows, Butterfly Viewer installs to your computer with an executable (.exe) installer similar to how other programs install on your computer. The Viewer will be added to your list of programs and optionally to your desktop as a shortcut.

Here v1.0.0 is shown in the screenshots, but you should use the [latest version](https://github.com/olive-groves/butterfly_viewer/releases/latest) unless advised otherwise.

![Butterfly Viewer shortcut and icon on Windows](images/install/windows_shortcut.jpg)

### Prerequisites

- The Viewer uses 106 MB of storage space as an installed app.

- The Viewer uses locally stored images (like PNG, JPEG, TIFF) to create and explore views of those images. It's designed to be navigated by mouse or trackpad by clicking, dragging, and dropping.

- The Viewer doesn't use the internet, so any online images you wish to use must be locally available — for example, by downloading them or by selecting “always keep on your device” if they sync to cloud storage like OneDrive or Google Drive. Images on network shares can be loaded into the Viewer, but they can take more time to load than those stored locally, especially if accessing the share through a VPN.

### Download ZIP

Download the Viewer from the latest release of the Viewer's GitHub repo, which is packaged as an installer under *Assets* as [`butterfly_viewer_v1.y.z_win64_setup.exe.zip`<sup>↗</sup>](https://github.com/olive-groves/butterfly_viewer/releases/latest).

![Screenshot showing the download link of the Butterfly Viewer installer ZIP on its GitHub repo.](images/install/download_zip.jpg)
<br>
<sup>Here v1.1 is shown, but you should download the [latest version](https://github.com/olive-groves/butterfly_viewer/releases/latest).</sup>

### Extract ZIP

Extract `butterfly_viewer_v1.y.z_win64_setup.exe` from the ZIP:

1. Go to the folder where you downloaded the ZIP.
2. Right-click the ZIP.
3. Select **Extract All...** or another extraction tool (like 7-Zip).

![Sequence of screenshots showing how to extract the Butterfly Viewer installer executable from the ZIP.](images/install/extract_zip.jpg)

### Run installer

**Note:** Your computer might block you from running the installer via double-click if you’re using a work computer or otherwise don’t have admin privileges:

- If you have no admin privileges, skip to [Option 2](#option-2-without-admin-privileges). 
- If you indeed have admin privileges, just follow [Option 1](#option-1-with-admin-privileges).

>*Why is it unrecognized and blocked?  In short, it’s because this installer has no certificate. If an installer's certificate isn't found by Windows when double-clicked, Windows will block it from immediately running.*

#### Installer option 1: With admin privileges

If you have admin privileges, run the installer by double-clicking on `butterfly_viewer_v1.y.z_win64_setup.exe`:

1. Double-click on `butterfly_viewer_v1.y.z_win64_setup.exe`.
2. Windows Defender SmartScreen may show a pop-up. If not, skip to step 5.
3. Select **More info**.
4. Select **Run anyway**.
  <br>
  <sup>No **Run anyway**? Select **Don't run** and [try Option 2.](#option-2-without-admin-privileges)</sup>
5. Wait for the installer to load. This may take a few seconds.

![Sequence of screenshots showing how to run the Butterfly Viewer installer by double-clicking it.](images/install/install_admin.jpg)

#### Installer option 2: Without admin privileges

If double-clicking the installer doesn’t work, run the installer via the command prompt.

>*Not possible? You can try installing on a virtual machine or contacting your machine admin.*

You can find various ways online on how to run an executable (EXE) via the command prompt, but I prefer these steps:
1. Copy the path of the installer:
  - Press and hold the `Shift` key and then **right-click** the file. Wait for the menu to load.
  - Select **Copy as path**.

2. Open the Start menu  (`⊞ Win`).
3. Type **cmd**.
4. Press the `Enter` key or select the Command Prompt app.
5. Paste into the prompt the installer path you copied with `Ctrl·V`.
6. Run by pressing `Enter`. 
7. Wait for the installer to load. This may take a few seconds.

![Sequence of screenshots showing how to run the Butterfly Viewer installer with the command prompt.](images/install/install_cmd.jpg)   

### Follow installer steps and install

Once the installer loads, follow the onscreen steps to install the Viewer:
- Accept the agreement. The license is [GNU GPL v3.0<sup>↗</sup>](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) or later.
- Choose the install folder. The default should be ok.
  <br>
  > *Updating with a newer version? First [uninstall the old version](#uninstall) and then re-run the new installer.

- Choose the Start Menu folder. The default should be ok, but you don't need to create a Start Menu folder to use the app.
- Choose to create a desktop shortcut. This can be useful to have.
- Install.
- Restart. **Restart recommended** to avoid issues with drag-and-drop not working.


![Two screenshots of the Butterfly Viewer installer: 1) the first page showing the license agreement, and 2) the final page confirming a completed install.](images/install/install_installer.jpg)   

### Run

To run the Viewer, search for **Butterfly Viewer** in the Start menu (`⊞ Win`) or double-click on the desktop shortcut if you added it upon install.

This tutorial guides you through the Butterfly Viewer's main features using a stack of sample technical images of Vincent van Gogh's *Small Pear Tree in Blossom*.


## Download sample Van Gogh images

Download the [ZIP of sample technical images<sup>↗</sup>](https://github.com/olive-groves/butterfly_images/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.zip) (**121 MB**) of *Small Pear Tree in Blossom* by Vincent van Gogh, with credits to the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (Vincent van Gogh Foundation).

Extract the ZIP and open the folder of images. <sup>How to: [Extract a ZIP](#extract-zip)</sup>

![Screenshot of the images folder from the downloaded sample ZIP.](images/tutorial/images_folder.jpg)


## Synchronized side-by-side images

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/viewer_dragdrop_sync.gif" alt="Animated screencapture of the Butterfly Viewer showing image files loaded via drag-and-drop and then synchronously panned and zoomed.">
  <br />
  <i>Synchronized pan and zoom</i>
</p>

Let's compare individual images side-by-side with synchronous movement and discover some basic features of the Viewer along the way.

First, start the Viewer.
- If you installed the Windows executable, search for **Butterfly Viewer** in the Start menu (`⊞ Win`) or double-click on its desktop shortcut. 
<br><sup>How to: [Run installed executable](#run)</sup>
- If you're using Python, execute `python butterfly_viewer`.
<br><sup>How to: [Run on Python](#install-and-run)</sup>

![Screenshot of the Viewer's empty startup screen.](images/tutorial/viewer_started.jpg)

We can hide the advanced features on the left because we're doing simple image comparison. 

Hide the interface by clicking ![Hide interface button](images/tutorial/hide_interface_button.png).

![Screenshots showing the Viewer's interface visible and hidden.](images/tutorial/hide_interface.jpg)

Let's add our first image: the color photograph of *Small Pear Tree in Blossom*.

Click and drag `s0039V1962_b_crop.png` from the sample images folder into the Viewer’s main area.

> **Drag-and-drop not working?** 
> Try restarting your computer and reopening the Viewer. 
>
> Some users report this solves issues with images not being droppable.

![Screenshot showing the color image file dragged into the Viewer's main area.](images/tutorial/drag_single.jpg)

![Screenshot showing the color image in the Viewer as a single individual image window.](images/tutorial/viewer_single.jpg)

Now let's add two more images to compare them: a raking light photograph and a zinc element map created using X-ray fluorescence mapping.

Click and drag these files into the Viewer:
- `s0039v1962_r2_registered_to_s0039V1962_b_crop.png`; and 
- `s0039V1962_Zn_MAXRF_registered_to_s0039V1962_b_crop.png`.

![Screenshots showing the raking light and zinc map dragged into the Viewer's main area.](images/tutorial/drag_multiple.jpg)

Clicking and dragging image files directly into the Viewer creates an individual image window for each image and automatically arranges them side-by-side. 

Images are arranges horizontally (left to right) by default, but you arrange them vertically or as a grid using the interface buttons on the bottom right of the Viewer. 

![Arrange and fit interface buttons](images/tutorial/arrange_buttons.jpg).

Zoom (scroll) and pan (left-click drag) to explore the images synchronously.

![Animated screencapture of the Butterfly Viewer showing image files loaded via drag-and-drop and then synchronously panned and zoomed.](images/viewer_dragdrop_sync.gif)

Can you find this specific blossom in the pear tree?

![Screenshot showing the Viewer with three synchronous views zoomed to a blossom in the sample image.](images/tutorial/zoom_blossom.jpg)

Try the shortcut to center and fit the image windows by clicking ![Fit and center button](images/tutorial/fit_center_button.png).

![Screenshot showing the Viewer with three synchronous views fitted and centered.](images/tutorial/fit_center.jpg)

Once you're done exploring the images, close them and unhide the interface.

Close all image windows with ![Close all views button](images/tutorial/close_all_button.png). 

Show the interface with ![Fit and center button](images/tutorial/show_interface_button.png).

![Screenshot showing the all windows in the Viewer closed and the interface unhidden.](images/tutorial/close_all_unhide_interface.jpg)


## Sliding overlays and opacity sliders

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/viewer_sliding_overlay.gif" alt="Animated screencapture of the Butterfly Viewer showing a sliding overlay with three images being panned and zoomed.">
  <br />
  <i>Sliding overlays</i>
</p>

Now let's use sliding overlays to compare the sample images we viewed side-by-side in the previous section. We'll also reveal opacity sliders and other features of the Viewer.

First, make sure the Viewer is started with the interface showing.

![Screenshot of the Viewer's empty startup screen.](images/tutorial/viewer_started.jpg)

The 2×2 interface in the top-left corner of the Viewer lets us create an image window with a sliding overlay. 

The concept of a sliding overlay is like a before-and-after slider but in two dimensions, allowing us to place up to three images over a base image and compare their contents all at the same point by sliding the cursor up, down, left, and right.

![Sliding overlay concept with a color photo of Small Pear Tree in Blossom as the base image with a raking light photo overlaid in the top-right and a zinc element map overlaid in the bottom-right.](images/tutorial/sliding_overlay_concept.jpg)

For the base image of our first sliding overlay, we'll use the color photograph of *Small Pear Tree in Blossom*. This acts as a "ground truth" with which we can compare overlaid images.

Drag and drop `s0039v1962_b_crop.png` from the sample images into the top-left tile of the sliding overlay creator. 

![Screenshot showing the color photo being dragged into the top-left base tile of the Viewer's sliding overlay creator.](images/tutorial/creator_base.jpg)

The other tiles in the creator are now unlocked because a base image is present, so let's add the raking light photograph and a zinc element map.

Individually click and drag these files into the creator:
- top-right tile: `s0039v1962_r2_registered_to_s0039V1962_b_crop.png`; and 
- bottom-right tile: `s0039V1962_Zn_MAXRF_registered_to_s0039V1962_b_crop.png`.

> To accurately compare images with a sliding overlay in the Viewer, those images must already be registered with one another. That means their aspect ratios must match, and the features within those images must be aligned.
> 
> The sample images here are already registered. If you want to easily create registered copies of your own images, check out [Butterfly Registrator<sup>↗</sup>](https://olive-groves.github.io/butterfly_registrator/butterfly_registrator.html).

![Screenshot indicating where in the sliding overlay creator to click and drag the raking light photo (top-right) and zinc element map (bottom-right).](images/tutorial/creator_topright_bottomright.jpg)

Now we can create a sliding overlay using the files we added.

Click Create to generate an image window with a sliding overlay.

![Screenshots showing a sliding overlay being created with the previously selected images.](images/tutorial/creator_create.jpg)

Move your cursor across the window to change the position of the "split" of the sliding overlay. 

The split is unlocked by default, meaning it will continuously follow your cursor.

![Animated screencapture of the Butterfly Viewer showing a sliding overlay with three images being panned and zoomed.](images/viewer_sliding_overlay.gif)

Zoom to the blossoms in the top-right of the pear tree.

![Screenshots showing a zoom section of the sliding overlay.](images/tutorial/sliding_overlay_zoom.jpg)

The sliders in the interface in the bottom-left corner of the Viewer let us adjust the opacities of the active sliding overlay.

Since the raking light image is directly over the base color image, we can blend in the color image by decreasing the opacity of the raking light image. In other words, we can make the raking light image semi-transparent and let in the color image underneath.

Drag the opacity slider of the top-right image to about 60%.

![Screenshot show the top-right opacity slider dragged to 60%.](images/tutorial/opacity_slider.jpg)

To more easily examine the blended images, we can lock the split of the sliding overlay.

First, pan and zoom the window such that you can place the cursor at the bottom-left the brick wall. 

Lock the split at the cursor position by pressing `Shift·X` on your keyboard.

![Screenshots showing the split of the sliding overlay before and after being locked.](images/tutorial/split_lock.jpg)

Pan and zoom to the brick wall.

Again move the opacity slider of the top-right image, this time left and right to reveal the brush strokes of Van Gogh.

![Screenshots showing the opacity of the raking light image being changed with the sliding overlay split locked.](images/tutorial/opacity_slider_lock.jpg)

Fit and center the image window.

Unlock the split by pressing `Shift·X` or by clicking Unlock Overlay.

![Screenshots showing the split of the sliding overlay being unlocked.](images/tutorial/split_unlock.jpg)

You can also try blending the zinc element map with the color image using the opacity slider, though in the next section we'll instead use alphascale versions of the element maps (not grayscale versions) to better visualize them over the color image.

Close the image window of the sliding overlay with X in the top-right corner.

Clear the tiles of the sliding overlay creator with their respective X.

![Screenshots showing the sliding overlay image window being closed and the tiles of the creator being cleared.](images/tutorial/close_window_clear_creator.jpg)


## Alphascale maps with sliding overlays

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/viewer_alphascale_overlay.gif" alt="Animated screencapture of the Butterfly Viewer showing a sliding overlay with four alphascale element maps being panned and zoomed.">
  <br />
  <i>Alphascale maps in a sliding overlay</i>
</p>

Here we're going to use alphascale versions of the XRF element maps to better compare them with the color photo of *Small Pear Tree in Blossom*. We'll use a sliding overlay as in the previous section, and also cover some more features of the Viewer.

First, make sure the Viewer is started with the interface showing.

![Screenshot of the Viewer's empty startup screen.](images/tutorial/viewer_started.jpg)

We'll again use the color photograph of *Small Pear Tree in Blossom* as the base image of the sliding overlay.

Then we'll add the alphascale versions of the bromine, chromium, and zinc element maps included in the sample images.

> Alphascale is a term we use to refer to a grayscale image converted such that the transparency of each pixel (*the alpha channel*) is proportional to how black or white the original grayscale pixel is. Details [here](#what-is-alphascale). Use the [alphascale creator](https://olive-groves.github.io/butterfly_registrator/butterfly_registrator.html) in Butterfly Registrator to convert your own grayscale maps to alphascale.
>
> <br> 
>
> ![Gradient bar from white to black in grayscale, white alphascale, and red alphacale.](images/tutorial/alphascale.png)

Individually click and drag these files into the creator, and then click Create:
- top-left (base) tile: `s0039V1962_b_crop.png`;
- top-right tile: `s0039V1962_Br_MAXRF_alphascale_rgb_255_0_0_registered_to_s0039V1962_b_crop.png`;  
- bottom-right tile: `s0039V1962_Cr_MAXRF_alphascale_rgb_0_255_0_registered_to_s0039V1962_b_crop.png`; and
- bottom-left tile: `s0039V1962_Zn_MAXRF_alphascale_rgb_255_255_255_registered_to_s0039V1962_b_crop.png`.

![Screenshot of the Viewer's empty startup screen.](images/tutorial/creator_alphascale.jpg)

If you want to quickly see each element map as a whole over the color image, you can use the interface grid of buttons in the bottom-left of the Viewer to temporarily move the sliding overlay to the edges of the image window.

Hover over (don't click!) the split shortcut arrows to temporarily move the split.

![Screenshots showing the split moving when the split shortcut buttons are hovere.](images/tutorial/split_shortcut.jpg)

By reducing the opacity of the base color image — in other words, by making the base image semi-transparent — we can make the colors of the alphascale maps "pop" and as a result make it easier to see where their respective elements are present in *Small Pear Tree in Blossom*.

Drag the opacity slider of the base image to about 40%.

![Screenshots showing the opacity of the base color image being changed.](images/tutorial/opacity_slider_base.jpg)

Can you find this area in the painting?

![Animated screencapture of the Butterfly Viewer showing a sliding overlay with four alphascale element maps being panned and zoomed.](images/viewer_alphascale_overlay.gif)

The Viewer can handle multiple simultaneous image windows with individual images and sliding overlays, all while synchronizing panning and zooming.

Try out other handy features of the Viewer:
- Toggle sync on/off with ![Sync toggle button](images/tutorial/sync_button.png).
- Go fullscreen by pressing the `F` key or with ![Fullscreen button](images/tutorial/fullscreen_button.png).
- Copy a screenshot to your clipboard with Ctrl·C or save it as an image with ![Save screenshot button](images/tutorial/screenshot_button.png).
- Explore other settings and tools by right-clicking an image window.

Lastly, can you create a set of image windows like this?

![Screenshot showing multiple image windows open in the Viewer.](images/tutorial/viewer_multi.jpg)

![Screenshot showing multiple image windows at various zoom and positions.](images/tutorial/viewer_multi_unsync.jpg)

Once finished, close the Viewer — or explore it further using your own images!

## Set zoom synchronization mode

Zoom can be synchronized by width, height, pixel size, or the fit-in-a-box method by right-clicking an image and selecting the mode under **Sync zoom by**.

![Screenshot showing right-click menu with the 'Sync zoom by...' submenu selected.](images/tutorial/right-click_sync_zoom.jpg)

Fit in a box (default): images are scaled to fit to the same sized square box.
![Screenshot showing sync by fit-in-a-box.](images/tutorial/sync_by_fit-in-a-box.jpg)

Sync by width: images are scaled to appear equally as wide.
![Screenshot showing sync by width.](images/tutorial/sync_by_width.jpg)

Height: images are scaled to appear equally as tall.
![Screenshot showing sync by height.](images/tutorial/sync_by_height.jpg)

Pixel (relative size): images are not scaled whereby pixels between images are the same size.
![Screenshot showing sync by pixel.](images/tutorial/sync_by_pixel.jpg)

Sliding overlays scale their non-base images using the fit-in-a-box method.
![Animated screencapture showing a sliding overlay with the same image at four different resolutions.](images/viewer_sliding_overlay_scaling.gif)


# Common questions

## Report a bug?

You can submit a [bug report<sup>↗</sup>](https://github.com/olive-groves/butterfly_viewer/issues/new/choose) as an issue on the Viewer's GitHub.


## Request new feature?

You can submit a [feature request<sup>↗</sup>](https://github.com/olive-groves/butterfly_viewer/issues/new/choose) as an issue on the Viewer's GitHub.

![GitHub New Issue page showing bug report and feature request options.](images/tutorial/bug_feature_issue.jpg)


## Seeing pixelated images?

![Screenshot showing upsample smoothing options in the right-click menu.](images/tutorial/upsample_rightclick.jpg)

By default, the Viewer does not smooth the pixels of images when you overzoom them. Smoothing is turned off to show you precisely where individual pixels are, which is otherwise difficult to do with it on. As a result, this can cause images to appear pixelated — which is true, because you're seeing the exact pixels.

You can toggle smoothing (*upsampling*) through the right-click menu on any image window.


## What is alphascale?

Alphascale is a term we use to refer to a grayscale image converted such that the transparency of each pixel (*the alpha channel*) is proportional to how black or white the original grayscale pixel is. The color of each pixel in the alphascale image is then set to the same color, like white or red.

![Gradient bar from white to black in grayscale, white alphascale, and red alphacale.](images/tutorial/alphascale.png)

For grayscale XRF maps converted to alphascale, this means the transparency represents the presence of an element: an opaque (non-transparent) pixel indicates the highest relative presence, whereas a see-through (transparent) pixel indicates the lowest relative presence. In other words, where in an 8-bit grayscale map white is high (255) and black is low (0), in its alphascale counterpart fully opaque is high (alpha=255) and fully transparent is low (alpha=0).

If you want to create alphascale versions of your own grayscale maps, check out [Butterfly Registrator<sup>↗</sup>](https://olive-groves.github.io/butterfly_registrator/butterfly_registrator.html).

Butterfly Viewer is a desktop multi-image viewer with sliding overlays, synchronized pan and zoom, and other handy features to rapidly compare local image files. This can be useful for visually inspecting painting research data such as high-res and raking-light photos, X-rays, and element maps from XRF and RIS.

The Viewer runs as an [installable Windows executable](https://olive-groves.github.io/butterfly_viewer/butterfly_viewer.html#windows-executable) or directly on its [Python source code](https://olive-groves.github.io/butterfly_viewer/butterfly_viewer.html#python).

Most types of PNG, JPEG, and TIFF can be loaded into the Viewer. 

[Butterfly Registrator](https://olive-groves.github.io/butterfly_registrator/butterfly_registrator.html) can be used to create aligned copies of your images so you can more accurately compare them with synced movement and sliding overlays in the Viewer. The Registrator helps you align (or *register*) images to a given reference image such that their heights and widths match and the features within those images line up.
